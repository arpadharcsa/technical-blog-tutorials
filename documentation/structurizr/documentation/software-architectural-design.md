## Introduction
Provide a brief overview of the project, its purpose, and the intended audience for this document.

## Architectural Goals and Constraints
List the key goals of the architecture, such as performance, scalability, maintainability, etc. Also, mention any constraints that may affect the design, such as regulatory requirements or technology limitations.

## System Overview
Describe the system's functionality and how it fits into the larger context. Include a high-level diagram if applicable.

## Architectural Patterns
Discuss the architectural patterns that will be used (e.g., Microservices, Monolithic, Event-Driven). Explain why these patterns were chosen.

## Component Design
### Component 1
- **Description**: Brief description of the component.
- **Responsibilities**: List the main responsibilities of the component.
- **Interactions**: Describe how this component interacts with other components.

### Component 2
- **Description**: Brief description of the component.
- **Responsibilities**: List the main responsibilities of the component.
- **Interactions**: Describe how this component interacts with other components.

## Data Design
Outline the data models, including entities, relationships, and any database design considerations. Include ER diagrams if necessary.

## Interface Design
Describe the interfaces between components, including APIs and protocols. Provide examples of request/response formats.

## Deployment View
Explain how the system will be deployed, including server architecture, cloud services, and any third-party services used.

## Security Considerations
Discuss security measures that will be implemented, such as authentication, authorization, data encryption, and compliance with standards.

## Quality Attributes
Identify the quality attributes that are important for the system, such as:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Usability
- Maintainability

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points of the architectural design and any next steps or considerations for implementation.
